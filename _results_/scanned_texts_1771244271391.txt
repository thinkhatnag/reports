￼  Good afternoon, Mrs. Smith. I'm Dr. Patel, the attending physician today. I've had a chance to briefly review your file, and I understand you've been experiencing quite a bit of discomfort, shortness of breath, and leg swelling.
￼  That sounds very distressing.
￼  What you're describing—shortness of breath at rest, needing to prop yourself up to sleep, and waking up gasping—those are concerning signs.
￼  We call those orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
￼  They're classic indicators of fluid buildup in the lungs, often linked to heart failure.
￼  It backs up in your circulation. It sounds like this has been gradually progressing.
￼  Yes, over the past few months. At first, I brushed it off, but recently I can't do even light chores around the house without feeling completely winded.
￼  Let's go through a few details to round out your medical history.
￼  I live alone now since my husband passed away.
￼  I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have family nearby or a support system?
￼  My daughter lives a few hours away. We talk regularly and she visits when she can. But day-to-day, I manage on my own.
￼  That's good to know.
￼  Are you taking anything currently for your diabetes?
￼  My mother had type 2 diabetes like me, and my sister has high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
￼  That family history is significant. Now let's go over your symptoms in detail. You're breathless at rest, have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and swelling in the lower limbs. Do you feel chest pain at all?
￼  Not pain exactly, it's more like tightness or pressure when I feel out of breath.
￼  Let's also review your allergies to ensure we avoid any complications.
￼  You're allergic to penicillin.
￼  Yes, I get hives and itching. A moderate reaction.
￼  And I once had a very bad reaction to shellfish—swelling, hives, trouble breathing.
￼  That sounds severe. Do you carry an epinephrine auto-injector?
￼  I do. Thankfully, I haven't had to use it.
￼  We'll make sure your chart is updated with all of that.
￼  How's your typical day-to-day activity? Are you still able to go for walks?
￼  You're slightly tachycardic and hypoxic, with an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, which aligns with your symptoms.
￼  Is that very dangerous?
￼  It's concerning, but treatable. We just need to intervene now to prevent it from getting worse.
￼  Your body mass index is 30.9, which puts you in the obese range. That's a contributing factor to both heart failure and diabetes, but we can tackle it with gradual lifestyle changes.
￼  I've been meaning to lose weight. It's just hard at this age.
￼  That's completely understandable.
